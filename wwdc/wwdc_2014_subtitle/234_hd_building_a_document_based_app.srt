[ Applause ]

3
00:00:13.186 --> 00:00:13.556 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

4
00:00:16.446 --> 00:00:17.286 A:middle
I'm Mike Hess.

5
00:00:17.286 --> 00:00:20.436 A:middle
I'm a software engineer on the
iOS Apps and Frameworks team

6
00:00:20.436 --> 00:00:22.866 A:middle
and I'm here with Johannes
Fortmann to talk to you

7
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:25.876 A:middle
about building great cloud
documents-based applications.

8
00:00:26.836 --> 00:00:28.006 A:middle
So here we go.

9
00:00:28.086 --> 00:00:30.776 A:middle
We've made some important
changes to iCloud.

10
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:34.196 A:middle
First, the iCloud daemon has
been completely rewritten

11
00:00:34.196 --> 00:00:35.336 A:middle
on top of CloudKit.

12
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.736 A:middle
We're calling it iCloud Drive.

13
00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:41.026 A:middle
If you're interested
in learning more

14
00:00:41.026 --> 00:00:42.836 A:middle
about CloudKit I encourage you

15
00:00:42.836 --> 00:00:45.496 A:middle
to attend their sessions
and labs.

16
00:00:45.896 --> 00:00:49.606 A:middle
Second, we've added
Windows support to iCloud.

17
00:00:50.176 --> 00:00:53.836 A:middle
Now your users with
Windows devices can access

18
00:00:53.836 --> 00:00:56.916 A:middle
and modify their documents
on their Windows devices.

19
00:00:58.216 --> 00:01:01.796 A:middle
Third, we've added an
iCloud folder into Finder.

20
00:01:02.706 --> 00:01:05.446 A:middle
Now your users can add
whatever documents they want

21
00:01:05.616 --> 00:01:07.686 A:middle
into their iCloud
folder in Finder

22
00:01:07.916 --> 00:01:10.746 A:middle
and organize them
however they see fit.

23
00:01:11.796 --> 00:01:16.156 A:middle
Fourth, we've added access
to this iCloud folder

24
00:01:16.156 --> 00:01:18.016 A:middle
from within your iOS apps.

25
00:01:18.276 --> 00:01:19.826 A:middle
We'll get into this
a little more later.

26
00:01:19.826 --> 00:01:22.266 A:middle
So what are we going
to cover here today?

27
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:25.256 A:middle
We're going to start off
by talking about some

28
00:01:25.256 --> 00:01:26.336 A:middle
of the best practices

29
00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:28.366 A:middle
of accessing your
documents in the cloud.

30
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:32.976 A:middle
Then we're going to move on to
talking about how to discover

31
00:01:32.976 --> 00:01:34.816 A:middle
and list your documents
in the cloud.

32
00:01:35.776 --> 00:01:39.736 A:middle
Next we're going to talk about
displaying thumbnails in your UI

33
00:01:39.736 --> 00:01:41.386 A:middle
when you're listing your
documents in the cloud.

34
00:01:42.316 --> 00:01:46.236 A:middle
Then we're going to talk about
accessing documents from outside

35
00:01:46.236 --> 00:01:49.206 A:middle
of your apps container such
as the shared iCloud folder.

36
00:01:50.506 --> 00:01:53.656 A:middle
And finally we're going to talk
about providing document storage

37
00:01:53.656 --> 00:01:55.956 A:middle
to other applications
from within your app.

38
00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:58.026 A:middle
So what is a document anyways?

39
00:01:59.156 --> 00:02:02.356 A:middle
We're going to define
a document here

40
00:02:02.356 --> 00:02:06.686 A:middle
as a single standalone entity
and it's understood by the user

41
00:02:06.686 --> 00:02:08.205 A:middle
as a single standalone entity.

42
00:02:08.886 --> 00:02:11.396 A:middle
A user might want to modify it

43
00:02:11.886 --> 00:02:13.996 A:middle
or give it a name
that's meaningful to them

44
00:02:14.476 --> 00:02:17.556 A:middle
or send it via email to one of
their friends or colleagues.

45
00:02:18.396 --> 00:02:20.706 A:middle
There are some documents
which we all sort

46
00:02:20.706 --> 00:02:21.976 A:middle
of understand are documents.

47
00:02:22.566 --> 00:02:25.646 A:middle
A keynote document
or a numbers document

48
00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:28.536 A:middle
or a pages document
are clearly documents.

49
00:02:28.986 --> 00:02:32.256 A:middle
But we're also going to consider
something like a chess game

50
00:02:32.256 --> 00:02:34.396 A:middle
to be a document for
this presentation.

51
00:02:35.106 --> 00:02:38.046 A:middle
A user might want to
save the current state

52
00:02:38.046 --> 00:02:41.186 A:middle
of their chess game and email
it to one of their friends

53
00:02:41.186 --> 00:02:42.666 A:middle
so they can pick up
where they left off

54
00:02:42.696 --> 00:02:44.386 A:middle
against some hard AI level.

55
00:02:44.846 --> 00:02:47.366 A:middle
So we're going to consider a
chess game to be a document.

56
00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:50.266 A:middle
Now let's talk about dealing

57
00:02:50.266 --> 00:02:51.536 A:middle
with your documents
in the cloud.

58
00:02:52.306 --> 00:02:55.476 A:middle
So it's important when you're
dealing with your documents

59
00:02:55.476 --> 00:02:58.016 A:middle
in the cloud to use
file coordination.

60
00:02:58.806 --> 00:03:00.366 A:middle
There are several
reasons for this,

61
00:03:00.366 --> 00:03:02.776 A:middle
but one of the main ones
is to avoid data loss.

62
00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:07.266 A:middle
You may have the simplest
single-threaded application

63
00:03:07.266 --> 00:03:10.556 A:middle
in the world, and you may think
that you're the only one reading

64
00:03:10.626 --> 00:03:12.216 A:middle
from or writing to
your documents,

65
00:03:12.516 --> 00:03:14.016 A:middle
but once you add the iCloud data

66
00:03:14.016 --> 00:03:16.316 A:middle
into the mix that's
no longer the case

67
00:03:16.346 --> 00:03:17.856 A:middle
so use file coordination.

68
00:03:18.636 --> 00:03:21.296 A:middle
Let's take a quick
example of this.

69
00:03:21.646 --> 00:03:24.186 A:middle
Say your app is doing
proper file coordination.

70
00:03:24.856 --> 00:03:26.316 A:middle
You'll write your
changes to disk,

71
00:03:26.896 --> 00:03:29.426 A:middle
the iCloud Drive daemon
will pick up those changes

72
00:03:29.486 --> 00:03:31.426 A:middle
and push them up to
the cloud and down

73
00:03:31.426 --> 00:03:33.066 A:middle
to all the other users' devices.

74
00:03:33.596 --> 00:03:35.056 A:middle
Everything's working
properly here.

75
00:03:35.376 --> 00:03:36.666 A:middle
That's what you want
to have happen.

76
00:03:37.786 --> 00:03:40.356 A:middle
Now let's say you're not using
proper file coordination.

77
00:03:41.966 --> 00:03:44.016 A:middle
You may be writing
your changes to disk,

78
00:03:44.146 --> 00:03:48.016 A:middle
but iCloud Drive may also be
writing changes at the same time

79
00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:49.276 A:middle
for that same document.

80
00:03:49.816 --> 00:03:51.956 A:middle
This could result in
a corrupt document

81
00:03:52.386 --> 00:03:55.946 A:middle
which the iCloud Drive daemon
will again push up to the cloud

82
00:03:55.946 --> 00:03:58.676 A:middle
and down to the other
users' devices which results

83
00:03:58.676 --> 00:04:01.466 A:middle
in data loss everywhere
so use file coordination.

84
00:04:01.466 --> 00:04:02.216 A:middle
It's very important.

85
00:04:03.466 --> 00:04:04.576 A:middle
There's good news though.

86
00:04:05.276 --> 00:04:07.316 A:middle
UIDocument makes things simple.

87
00:04:08.406 --> 00:04:10.546 A:middle
UIDocument and NSDocument

88
00:04:10.546 --> 00:04:13.196 A:middle
on OS X does all the
heavy lifting for you.

89
00:04:13.626 --> 00:04:15.396 A:middle
It takes care of
file coordination.

90
00:04:15.946 --> 00:04:19.616 A:middle
It also uses background queues
to prevent the file coordination

91
00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:24.526 A:middle
from blocking your apps UI,
and UIDocument provides you

92
00:04:24.526 --> 00:04:26.306 A:middle
with several high-level APIs

93
00:04:26.306 --> 00:04:28.086 A:middle
for whatever use
case you might have.

94
00:04:29.946 --> 00:04:32.836 A:middle
Let's take a quick example
like reading a document

95
00:04:32.836 --> 00:04:37.526 A:middle
from disk with UIDocument.

96
00:04:39.916 --> 00:04:44.856 A:middle
So at the highest level
UIDocument does all

97
00:04:44.856 --> 00:04:46.376 A:middle
of the file coordination for you

98
00:04:46.676 --> 00:04:50.256 A:middle
and in addition reads
your document from disk.

99
00:04:50.256 --> 00:04:53.566 A:middle
If your document is a file
you'll get an NSData object

100
00:04:53.566 --> 00:04:55.526 A:middle
which is the contents
of your file on disk

101
00:04:55.966 --> 00:04:59.246 A:middle
and if the document is a package
you'll get an NSFileWrapper

102
00:04:59.246 --> 00:05:01.496 A:middle
object which represents
your package on disk.

103
00:05:01.976 --> 00:05:05.156 A:middle
You just have to override the
LoadFromContentsofType method

104
00:05:05.156 --> 00:05:08.616 A:middle
and then display the contents
of the document to your users.

105
00:05:09.216 --> 00:05:14.236 A:middle
At a slightly lower level
UIDocument still does all

106
00:05:14.236 --> 00:05:15.686 A:middle
of the file coordination
for you,

107
00:05:16.276 --> 00:05:19.376 A:middle
but this time you would an
NSURL back which is the location

108
00:05:19.376 --> 00:05:20.506 A:middle
of your document on disk.

109
00:05:21.216 --> 00:05:23.586 A:middle
You then just have
to read the document

110
00:05:23.586 --> 00:05:25.026 A:middle
and display it to your users.

111
00:05:25.546 --> 00:05:29.276 A:middle
At the lowest level we have an
option that's really provided

112
00:05:29.276 --> 00:05:30.076 A:middle
only for hooking.

113
00:05:31.016 --> 00:05:33.836 A:middle
If you override the
openWithCompletionHandler method

114
00:05:34.106 --> 00:05:36.496 A:middle
you should really invoke
super and implement one

115
00:05:36.496 --> 00:05:37.766 A:middle
of the other two methods.

116
00:05:38.636 --> 00:05:40.346 A:middle
You can override
this method though

117
00:05:40.686 --> 00:05:43.286 A:middle
if you want some custom
application behavior

118
00:05:43.286 --> 00:05:46.016 A:middle
when UIDocument would be
doing the file coordination

119
00:05:46.016 --> 00:05:49.286 A:middle
to read the document from disk.

120
00:05:50.306 --> 00:05:52.876 A:middle
New in IOS 8 we have
some asynchronous file

121
00:05:52.876 --> 00:05:54.256 A:middle
coordination APIs.

122
00:05:55.486 --> 00:05:58.696 A:middle
So the existing file
coordination APIs were

123
00:05:58.696 --> 00:05:59.876 A:middle
completely synchronous.

124
00:06:00.846 --> 00:06:03.616 A:middle
That means you would have to
do your own background queuing

125
00:06:03.656 --> 00:06:07.326 A:middle
to prevent file coordination
from blocking your app.

126
00:06:07.326 --> 00:06:09.756 A:middle
That can be a little
bit tricky to do.

127
00:06:09.906 --> 00:06:12.956 A:middle
So we have some new
file coordinator APIs

128
00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:14.746 A:middle
for asynchronous
file coordination

129
00:06:15.376 --> 00:06:17.916 A:middle
which is the coordinateAccess
WithIntents method.

130
00:06:19.036 --> 00:06:21.216 A:middle
We also have a new
corresponding class

131
00:06:21.636 --> 00:06:26.036 A:middle
which is the NSFileAccessIntent
class

132
00:06:26.576 --> 00:06:29.936 A:middle
which essentially just
contains a URL and some options

133
00:06:29.966 --> 00:06:31.606 A:middle
for your intent of coordination.

134
00:06:32.406 --> 00:06:34.016 A:middle
You pass these in an array

135
00:06:34.066 --> 00:06:35.816 A:middle
to the
coordinateAccessWithIntents

136
00:06:35.816 --> 00:06:39.846 A:middle
method to do your file
coordination operations.

137
00:06:40.406 --> 00:06:42.426 A:middle
Let's take a quick look at
that in some simple code.

138
00:06:44.196 --> 00:06:47.126 A:middle
So this code might be if
I want to copy a document

139
00:06:47.126 --> 00:06:48.516 A:middle
from one location to another.

140
00:06:49.376 --> 00:06:53.006 A:middle
As you can see I
allocate a source intent

141
00:06:53.376 --> 00:06:56.356 A:middle
to read the document where
it currently exists on disk.

142
00:06:57.256 --> 00:07:00.886 A:middle
I then allocate a destination
intent for the location

143
00:07:00.886 --> 00:07:02.776 A:middle
that I want to copy
the document to.

144
00:07:03.346 --> 00:07:07.026 A:middle
I pass these to the
file coordinator method

145
00:07:07.026 --> 00:07:11.076 A:middle
of coordinateAccess
WithIntents and at some point

146
00:07:11.076 --> 00:07:13.496 A:middle
in the future my accessor
block will be called

147
00:07:13.496 --> 00:07:14.606 A:middle
on the queue I provide.

148
00:07:15.456 --> 00:07:18.816 A:middle
I then just have to do my
operation in my accessor block.

149
00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:22.876 A:middle
Now it's important when
you do your operation

150
00:07:22.876 --> 00:07:26.456 A:middle
in your accessor block to use
the URLs that are attached

151
00:07:26.736 --> 00:07:28.676 A:middle
to the NSFileAccessIntents

152
00:07:28.976 --> 00:07:31.716 A:middle
because they may have
changed while you were waiting

153
00:07:31.716 --> 00:07:32.626 A:middle
for your coordination.

154
00:07:35.586 --> 00:07:37.406 A:middle
Now let's move on to discovering

155
00:07:37.406 --> 00:07:41.706 A:middle
and listing your
documents in the cloud.

156
00:07:42.546 --> 00:07:46.626 A:middle
So the way to discovery and list
your documents in the cloud is

157
00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:49.706 A:middle
through the existing
NSMetadataQuery APIs.

158
00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:56.956 A:middle
Now in previous versions of iOS
NSMetadataQuery has been slow

159
00:07:56.956 --> 00:07:59.206 A:middle
to pick up your local changes

160
00:07:59.206 --> 00:08:01.606 A:middle
like creates, deletes
and renames.

161
00:08:02.176 --> 00:08:03.456 A:middle
Let's take a quick look at this.

162
00:08:04.286 --> 00:08:07.666 A:middle
So let's say you have your app,
you have a couple of documents

163
00:08:07.666 --> 00:08:10.476 A:middle
in your apps container,
you also have a couple

164
00:08:10.476 --> 00:08:14.486 A:middle
of NSMetadata items from your
NSMetadataQuery which correspond

165
00:08:14.486 --> 00:08:16.786 A:middle
to those documents on disk.

166
00:08:17.206 --> 00:08:19.756 A:middle
Now let's say your app
creates a new document on disk.

167
00:08:20.556 --> 00:08:24.776 A:middle
There might be a long delay
before NSMetadataQuery updates

168
00:08:24.776 --> 00:08:27.946 A:middle
and gives you a new
NSMetadata item corresponding

169
00:08:27.946 --> 00:08:30.026 A:middle
to that newly created
local document.

170
00:08:30.566 --> 00:08:35.686 A:middle
New in iOS 8 NSMetadataQuery
is easier

171
00:08:35.686 --> 00:08:37.416 A:middle
to use directly with stitching.

172
00:08:38.525 --> 00:08:40.466 A:middle
Let's take a look at that.

173
00:08:40.976 --> 00:08:43.885 A:middle
Now let's say your app creates
this new document on disk

174
00:08:43.885 --> 00:08:46.186 A:middle
and is using proper
file coordination.

175
00:08:46.186 --> 00:08:48.876 A:middle
This only works if you create
the document using proper

176
00:08:48.876 --> 00:08:49.776 A:middle
file coordination.

177
00:08:50.506 --> 00:08:54.416 A:middle
We actually have a hook in
your file coordination access

178
00:08:54.856 --> 00:08:58.166 A:middle
which will update the
NSMetadataQuery quickly

179
00:08:58.166 --> 00:09:01.976 A:middle
and automatically to
create a new NSMetadata item

180
00:09:02.016 --> 00:09:03.546 A:middle
to update your app.

181
00:09:04.036 --> 00:09:06.786 A:middle
That means that you no
longer need two data sources

182
00:09:07.276 --> 00:09:10.676 A:middle
to show your app's UI
one from local changes

183
00:09:10.676 --> 00:09:12.786 A:middle
and one for cloud changes.

184
00:09:13.036 --> 00:09:14.596 A:middle
You just need NSMetadataQuery
[applause].

185
00:09:16.236 --> 00:09:21.216 A:middle
Thank you.

186
00:09:22.676 --> 00:09:26.696 A:middle
Also, NSMetadataQuery can
list non-local documents.

187
00:09:27.496 --> 00:09:30.676 A:middle
You may want to display
some file system attributes

188
00:09:30.676 --> 00:09:34.306 A:middle
about those documents
though to display in your UI

189
00:09:34.306 --> 00:09:35.686 A:middle
when you're listing
your documents.

190
00:09:36.746 --> 00:09:39.546 A:middle
We have a new NSURL API for you

191
00:09:39.986 --> 00:09:42.136 A:middle
which will let you get
file system attributes

192
00:09:42.136 --> 00:09:43.746 A:middle
about those documents which may

193
00:09:43.746 --> 00:09:46.236 A:middle
or may not have their
content available locally.

194
00:09:46.876 --> 00:09:49.276 A:middle
The way to do this is
with the NSURL method,

195
00:09:49.646 --> 00:09:52.126 A:middle
getPromisedItem
ResourceValue:forKey.

196
00:09:53.016 --> 00:09:56.206 A:middle
If you want more than one file
system attribute we also have a

197
00:09:56.206 --> 00:09:58.466 A:middle
bulk method which is
the promisedItemResource

198
00:09:58.466 --> 00:09:59.386 A:middle
ValuesForKeys.

199
00:10:00.146 --> 00:10:05.446 A:middle
You don't need to be
under file coordination

200
00:10:05.596 --> 00:10:08.506 A:middle
when using these methods
for listing your documents.

201
00:10:11.206 --> 00:10:16.046 A:middle
Also, if you are under file
coordination we have some new

202
00:10:16.046 --> 00:10:18.296 A:middle
file coordinator flags
for dealing with metadata.

203
00:10:19.996 --> 00:10:24.376 A:middle
The key difference with these
methods is that the content

204
00:10:24.446 --> 00:10:28.126 A:middle
with these flags that you pass
through your file coordinator is

205
00:10:28.126 --> 00:10:30.366 A:middle
that the content of the
documents does not need

206
00:10:30.366 --> 00:10:34.226 A:middle
to be available locally when
you are doing file coordination

207
00:10:34.226 --> 00:10:35.306 A:middle
using these flags.

208
00:10:36.316 --> 00:10:38.396 A:middle
Now let's move onto
document thumbnails.

209
00:10:39.326 --> 00:10:41.996 A:middle
So we think the best
user experience

210
00:10:42.286 --> 00:10:44.646 A:middle
when you're listing your
documents in your app is

211
00:10:44.646 --> 00:10:46.506 A:middle
to show document previews.

212
00:10:47.086 --> 00:10:49.356 A:middle
This gives your user
more context

213
00:10:50.086 --> 00:10:52.276 A:middle
so that they can
quickly identify

214
00:10:52.276 --> 00:10:55.466 A:middle
which document is meaningful
to them at that point in time.

215
00:10:56.456 --> 00:11:01.036 A:middle
As you can see in this pages
app we have document previews

216
00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:03.866 A:middle
which lets your user
quickly identify

217
00:11:03.866 --> 00:11:05.076 A:middle
which document is which.

218
00:11:05.706 --> 00:11:10.686 A:middle
Now it was possible to show
document previews previously,

219
00:11:10.806 --> 00:11:12.996 A:middle
but it required a
custom implementation.

220
00:11:13.826 --> 00:11:18.506 A:middle
New in iOS 8 we have some new
file system attributes keys

221
00:11:18.506 --> 00:11:21.056 A:middle
for you to display
thumbnails in your app.

222
00:11:21.966 --> 00:11:23.296 A:middle
The main way to do this is

223
00:11:23.296 --> 00:11:25.836 A:middle
with the NSURLThumbnail
DictionaryKey.

224
00:11:26.256 --> 00:11:29.736 A:middle
If you call this on
your document using the

225
00:11:29.736 --> 00:11:32.836 A:middle
getPromisedItem ResourceValue
:forKey method you'll get a

226
00:11:32.836 --> 00:11:35.626 A:middle
dictionary which
contains your thumbnails

227
00:11:35.706 --> 00:11:38.106 A:middle
which you can display
on your UI.

228
00:11:38.526 --> 00:11:41.796 A:middle
The only key in this dictionary
right now is the NSThumbnail

229
00:11:41.796 --> 00:11:47.036 A:middle
2024x1024SizeKey which
corresponds to the UIImage

230
00:11:47.036 --> 00:11:51.066 A:middle
or NSImage which you can
then just display in your UI.

231
00:11:52.176 --> 00:11:54.416 A:middle
Now onto saving document
thumbnails.

232
00:11:55.096 --> 00:11:57.796 A:middle
So the easiest way
to save thumbnails is

233
00:11:57.796 --> 00:11:58.906 A:middle
through UIDocument.

234
00:12:00.046 --> 00:12:03.146 A:middle
If you override the
fileAttributesTo WriteToURL

235
00:12:03.146 --> 00:12:08.196 A:middle
:forSaveOperation method and
have it generate a UIImage

236
00:12:08.546 --> 00:12:09.376 A:middle
which is your thumbnail

237
00:12:09.376 --> 00:12:12.866 A:middle
and return it UIDocument
will automatically write the

238
00:12:12.866 --> 00:12:14.336 A:middle
thumbnail to disk for you

239
00:12:14.706 --> 00:12:17.166 A:middle
and then the iCloud daemon
will go ahead and pick

240
00:12:17.166 --> 00:12:20.096 A:middle
up those changes and push
them up to the cloud.

241
00:12:21.066 --> 00:12:24.036 A:middle
Alternatively, if you're not
using UIDocument you can save

242
00:12:24.036 --> 00:12:28.026 A:middle
your thumbnails manually using
the existing NSURLsetResource

243
00:12:28.026 --> 00:12:30.376 A:middle
Value:forKey method,
but you should really be

244
00:12:30.376 --> 00:12:32.716 A:middle
under file coordination
when you invoke this method.

245
00:12:33.286 --> 00:12:38.326 A:middle
On OS X thumbnails are actually
generated for you automatically.

246
00:12:39.226 --> 00:12:42.686 A:middle
However, if you have a custom
document format you'll need

247
00:12:42.686 --> 00:12:46.226 A:middle
to let Quick Look know
how to display thumbnails

248
00:12:46.226 --> 00:12:48.326 A:middle
for your documents, so you'll
need a Quick Look plug-in

249
00:12:48.546 --> 00:12:49.596 A:middle
to generate your thumbnails.

250
00:12:50.326 --> 00:12:55.256 A:middle
Now let's move onto to
discovery documents outside

251
00:12:55.256 --> 00:12:56.336 A:middle
of your apps container.

252
00:12:56.876 --> 00:13:03.506 A:middle
Now in previous version
of iOS it's been difficult

253
00:13:03.506 --> 00:13:06.826 A:middle
for your users to
access documents outside

254
00:13:06.826 --> 00:13:09.076 A:middle
of your apps container
from within your app.

255
00:13:09.326 --> 00:13:11.746 A:middle
Let's take a look at how they
might do this previously.

256
00:13:12.816 --> 00:13:14.216 A:middle
So let's say you have your app.

257
00:13:14.806 --> 00:13:16.876 A:middle
You have direct access
to all the documents

258
00:13:16.876 --> 00:13:18.196 A:middle
in your app's container.

259
00:13:18.566 --> 00:13:19.596 A:middle
There's no problem there.

260
00:13:19.596 --> 00:13:22.136 A:middle
But let's say your user wants

261
00:13:22.136 --> 00:13:26.196 A:middle
to open say document three
from within your app.

262
00:13:26.396 --> 00:13:28.166 A:middle
How might they go
about doing this?

263
00:13:28.776 --> 00:13:31.306 A:middle
Well, one way they might
do this is they would have

264
00:13:31.376 --> 00:13:32.956 A:middle
to launch the other app,

265
00:13:33.426 --> 00:13:36.746 A:middle
then using the UIDocument
interaction controller make a

266
00:13:36.746 --> 00:13:39.266 A:middle
copy of the document from
the other apps container

267
00:13:39.526 --> 00:13:41.066 A:middle
into your app's local container.

268
00:13:41.856 --> 00:13:45.406 A:middle
Only then could they read the
document from within your app.

269
00:13:45.736 --> 00:13:49.466 A:middle
We think a better
user experience is

270
00:13:49.466 --> 00:13:52.116 A:middle
if your app can just
access those documents

271
00:13:52.116 --> 00:13:53.816 A:middle
in the other apps
container directly.

272
00:13:54.426 --> 00:13:56.526 A:middle
So if you have your app again

273
00:13:56.526 --> 00:14:00.406 A:middle
if you can just open those
documents directly the user

274
00:14:00.406 --> 00:14:00.896 A:middle
is happy.

275
00:14:01.906 --> 00:14:04.096 A:middle
So we think that's a
better user experience.

276
00:14:04.636 --> 00:14:07.646 A:middle
New in iOS 8 there's
a way to do this

277
00:14:07.646 --> 00:14:09.986 A:middle
with a UIDocumentPicker
ViewController.

278
00:14:11.096 --> 00:14:14.376 A:middle
This allows your users to
discover documents outside

279
00:14:14.376 --> 00:14:18.246 A:middle
of your app's sandbox and
lets your users grant your app

280
00:14:18.246 --> 00:14:21.526 A:middle
permission to access
and modify the documents

281
00:14:21.586 --> 00:14:22.476 A:middle
that they have chosen.

282
00:14:23.086 --> 00:14:27.846 A:middle
Now to have your
apps container show

283
00:14:27.846 --> 00:14:30.656 A:middle
up in the document
picker you have to opt-in

284
00:14:31.046 --> 00:14:32.306 A:middle
by marking your container

285
00:14:32.306 --> 00:14:35.856 A:middle
with a NSUbiquitousContainer
IsDocumjentScopePublic

286
00:14:36.946 --> 00:14:39.396 A:middle
to be yes in your info P list.

287
00:14:39.396 --> 00:14:44.566 A:middle
I have a great new UI --
we have a great new UI here

288
00:14:45.196 --> 00:14:47.406 A:middle
which you can display in
your app for your users

289
00:14:47.406 --> 00:14:49.936 A:middle
to choose documents and
I'd like to show you

290
00:14:49.936 --> 00:14:51.376 A:middle
that now with a quick demo.

291
00:14:52.026 --> 00:14:55.106 A:middle
Okay. Let's go ahead
and launch my app.

292
00:14:55.456 --> 00:14:56.286 A:middle
Yeah, the app I've written.

293
00:14:56.286 --> 00:14:58.056 A:middle
It's a simple text editing app.

294
00:14:58.606 --> 00:15:00.856 A:middle
So as you can see, I'm
using NSMetadataQuery

295
00:15:00.856 --> 00:15:03.836 A:middle
to list only one document
in my container right now,

296
00:15:04.636 --> 00:15:07.116 A:middle
but I'm using NSMetadataQuery
without file coordination

297
00:15:07.116 --> 00:15:11.026 A:middle
to list my documents and
display a quick simple preview

298
00:15:11.026 --> 00:15:11.676 A:middle
of the documents.

299
00:15:12.306 --> 00:15:14.366 A:middle
Now let's go ahead and launch
up the document picker.

300
00:15:15.256 --> 00:15:17.376 A:middle
So this is our new
document picker UI.

301
00:15:17.376 --> 00:15:21.076 A:middle
As you can see there are
several containers listed here

302
00:15:21.226 --> 00:15:25.746 A:middle
but I also have a document which
lives in the shared icon folder

303
00:15:25.746 --> 00:15:28.036 A:middle
which is listed alongside
my containers.

304
00:15:28.756 --> 00:15:30.746 A:middle
Now I can switch
to list view here.

305
00:15:30.746 --> 00:15:34.396 A:middle
There's a bunch of stuff I can
do, sort by name, tag, state,

306
00:15:34.396 --> 00:15:37.646 A:middle
etc. Now let's go
ahead and like drill

307
00:15:37.646 --> 00:15:42.476 A:middle
down into this text edit
container and select a document

308
00:15:42.476 --> 00:15:44.966 A:middle
from the text edit container.

309
00:15:44.966 --> 00:15:47.996 A:middle
So now I have opened the
document which actually lives

310
00:15:48.056 --> 00:15:49.276 A:middle
in the text edit container.

311
00:15:49.276 --> 00:15:51.436 A:middle
I have not made a
copy of this document.

312
00:15:51.966 --> 00:15:54.896 A:middle
This document still exists in
the text edit container but now

313
00:15:54.896 --> 00:15:59.136 A:middle
that iOS user had granted
my access to it I can edit

314
00:15:59.136 --> 00:16:01.926 A:middle
and access it in the
text edit container.

315
00:16:02.976 --> 00:16:05.236 A:middle
Let's go ahead and
x out of this.

316
00:16:05.766 --> 00:16:09.376 A:middle
As you can see, now that
I've granted my app access

317
00:16:09.376 --> 00:16:14.036 A:middle
to this document it has now
updated in the NSMetadataQuery

318
00:16:14.466 --> 00:16:18.296 A:middle
and I can list it alongside
the other documents in my app.

319
00:16:18.836 --> 00:16:21.066 A:middle
I've also annotated
it as you can see

320
00:16:21.066 --> 00:16:24.016 A:middle
with a text edit name just
to tell my user that it lives

321
00:16:24.016 --> 00:16:25.166 A:middle
in the text edit container.

322
00:16:26.026 --> 00:16:33.256 A:middle
Let's take a quick
look at this in code.

323
00:16:33.396 --> 00:16:35.896 A:middle
So this is basically all
the code I had to write

324
00:16:36.386 --> 00:16:38.106 A:middle
to display the document picker.

325
00:16:38.796 --> 00:16:43.566 A:middle
All I have to do is allocate
the document view controller

326
00:16:44.036 --> 00:16:46.566 A:middle
and pass it on array
of the document types

327
00:16:46.566 --> 00:16:47.666 A:middle
that I'm interested in.

328
00:16:48.366 --> 00:16:50.196 A:middle
I have a simple text editing app

329
00:16:50.546 --> 00:16:54.396 A:middle
so I only passed the plain
text UTI as the documents

330
00:16:54.396 --> 00:16:56.086 A:middle
that my app can access.

331
00:16:56.636 --> 00:16:58.356 A:middle
I then just present
the view controller

332
00:16:59.306 --> 00:17:01.866 A:middle
and then implement these
two simple delicate methods

333
00:17:02.596 --> 00:17:05.876 A:middle
and finally when the document --
when the user picks a document

334
00:17:05.876 --> 00:17:08.596 A:middle
of a given URL I just load it
and display it to my users.

335
00:17:08.675 --> 00:17:09.496 A:middle
It's super simple.

336
00:17:10.925 --> 00:17:14.866 A:middle
Now if you noticed my
app did not actually show

337
00:17:14.866 --> 00:17:15.896 A:middle
up in the document picker.

338
00:17:16.746 --> 00:17:21.316 A:middle
That's because I
haven't set my container

339
00:17:21.316 --> 00:17:22.945 A:middle
to be a public container yet.

340
00:17:22.945 --> 00:17:25.996 A:middle
Let's take just a quick
look at how to do that.

341
00:17:27.306 --> 00:17:33.836 A:middle
So if I open up my info P list
here, drill down into this.

342
00:17:35.136 --> 00:17:38.816 A:middle
As you can see my document
scope is set to be not public.

343
00:17:39.536 --> 00:17:43.716 A:middle
All I have to do is set this TS

344
00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:47.536 A:middle
and then bump the
bundled version

345
00:17:48.196 --> 00:17:53.206 A:middle
so that the document picker
knows that I have made a change

346
00:17:53.206 --> 00:17:57.286 A:middle
to my info P list and then
my app will be displayed

347
00:17:57.286 --> 00:18:01.356 A:middle
in the document picker so
that other apps can get access

348
00:18:01.356 --> 00:18:02.176 A:middle
to my documents.

349
00:18:02.946 --> 00:18:03.296 A:middle
All right.

350
00:18:03.296 --> 00:18:03.966 A:middle
So a quick summary.

351
00:18:04.696 --> 00:18:06.916 A:middle
We've just shown
you how easy it is

352
00:18:06.916 --> 00:18:10.566 A:middle
to display the document
picker inside your app

353
00:18:11.406 --> 00:18:14.946 A:middle
and how easy it is for users
to grant your app access

354
00:18:14.946 --> 00:18:16.986 A:middle
to documents in other
apps' containers

355
00:18:17.076 --> 00:18:18.946 A:middle
such as the shared icon folder.

356
00:18:20.236 --> 00:18:23.126 A:middle
We've also shown you how easy it
is to make your containers show

357
00:18:23.126 --> 00:18:27.126 A:middle
up in the UIDocumentPicker just
by setting a flag to be yes

358
00:18:27.576 --> 00:18:29.086 A:middle
and then bumping
your bundled version.

359
00:18:29.646 --> 00:18:34.986 A:middle
With that I would like to
Johannes Fortmann to the stage

360
00:18:35.186 --> 00:18:37.086 A:middle
who is going to talk
to you about some

361
00:18:37.086 --> 00:18:39.656 A:middle
of the key principals
behind the document picker.

362
00:18:40.046 --> 00:18:41.666 A:middle
Please welcome Johannes
to the stage [applause].

363
00:18:47.066 --> 00:18:47.646 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Mike.

364
00:18:48.116 --> 00:18:51.806 A:middle
Hi, I'm Johannes from the UIKit
team and I would like to talk

365
00:18:51.806 --> 00:18:56.176 A:middle
to you about some of
the main differences

366
00:18:56.546 --> 00:18:59.226 A:middle
between external
documents and documents

367
00:18:59.256 --> 00:19:00.516 A:middle
that may live in your container.

368
00:19:01.336 --> 00:19:07.346 A:middle
As you know, your application
right now has access

369
00:19:07.476 --> 00:19:09.106 A:middle
to its own container only.

370
00:19:10.396 --> 00:19:15.326 A:middle
So you're able to read and
write the documents inside your

371
00:19:15.326 --> 00:19:15.956 A:middle
own container.

372
00:19:16.606 --> 00:19:19.696 A:middle
And as you have seen
in Mike's demonstration

373
00:19:19.746 --> 00:19:25.406 A:middle
for other documents what we do
is once the user has chosen this

374
00:19:25.916 --> 00:19:29.526 A:middle
document we save a
so-called document reference

375
00:19:29.976 --> 00:19:30.956 A:middle
into your container.

376
00:19:32.276 --> 00:19:35.266 A:middle
This document reference
will then go and point

377
00:19:35.336 --> 00:19:38.126 A:middle
to your external document.

378
00:19:39.426 --> 00:19:42.326 A:middle
To ease this new concept

379
00:19:42.326 --> 00:19:46.216 A:middle
into your application we
provide a few new features

380
00:19:46.216 --> 00:19:48.566 A:middle
and attributes on
the NSMetadataQuery.

381
00:19:50.556 --> 00:19:53.366 A:middle
You are probably using
the NSMetaDataQuery

382
00:19:53.366 --> 00:19:55.706 A:middle
with the UbiquitousDocuments
Scope right now

383
00:19:56.006 --> 00:19:58.976 A:middle
to list the documents that are
inside your container locally.

384
00:19:59.046 --> 00:20:03.936 A:middle
And even if the user has
granted your application access

385
00:20:03.996 --> 00:20:07.296 A:middle
to a document outside
of your container,

386
00:20:07.736 --> 00:20:10.906 A:middle
even if the user has gotten
your application access

387
00:20:10.976 --> 00:20:14.936 A:middle
to document outside of your
container we will still continue

388
00:20:14.936 --> 00:20:19.006 A:middle
to merely list the documents
that are local to your container

389
00:20:19.006 --> 00:20:21.186 A:middle
as long as you don't
pass a new scope

390
00:20:21.626 --> 00:20:24.276 A:middle
which is the UbiquitousExternal
DocumentScope.

391
00:20:25.096 --> 00:20:27.916 A:middle
The UbiquitousExternal
DocumentScope ensures

392
00:20:27.916 --> 00:20:30.706 A:middle
that you've got an NSMetadata
item that corresponds

393
00:20:30.736 --> 00:20:34.666 A:middle
to the file references
that the user has extended

394
00:20:34.936 --> 00:20:37.446 A:middle
to your application container.

395
00:20:38.646 --> 00:20:43.116 A:middle
Now, these new NSMetadata
items are effectively just

396
00:20:43.116 --> 00:20:44.016 A:middle
like the old ones.

397
00:20:44.446 --> 00:20:47.236 A:middle
They also have an
NSMetadata item URL key

398
00:20:47.566 --> 00:20:51.576 A:middle
and this NSMetadata
item URL key will point

399
00:20:51.806 --> 00:20:57.476 A:middle
to this NSMetadata item URL
key will point to the URL

400
00:20:57.476 --> 00:21:01.126 A:middle
that your document is
actually located at.

401
00:21:01.466 --> 00:21:04.276 A:middle
That means that if your app is
using the NSMetadata item URL

402
00:21:04.276 --> 00:21:07.256 A:middle
key right now to
access the rile directly

403
00:21:07.256 --> 00:21:09.766 A:middle
that will still work even
with the document reference.

404
00:21:10.316 --> 00:21:14.976 A:middle
You can pass the return value
of getting this key directly

405
00:21:14.976 --> 00:21:19.706 A:middle
to for example a
UIDocument and use that URL

406
00:21:19.876 --> 00:21:23.136 A:middle
to directly access
the external document.

407
00:21:23.796 --> 00:21:26.536 A:middle
Now of course sometimes that
is not actually what you want

408
00:21:26.536 --> 00:21:26.886 A:middle
to do.

409
00:21:27.306 --> 00:21:28.406 A:middle
Sometimes what you're interested

410
00:21:28.406 --> 00:21:32.426 A:middle
in is not the actual document
backing this reference,

411
00:21:32.516 --> 00:21:34.896 A:middle
but rather the reference itself.

412
00:21:35.396 --> 00:21:36.416 A:middle
For example, you may want

413
00:21:36.416 --> 00:21:38.876 A:middle
to display the reference
inside a folder

414
00:21:38.876 --> 00:21:41.546 A:middle
in your application's
container in your UI,

415
00:21:42.086 --> 00:21:44.256 A:middle
or you might even
want to allow the user

416
00:21:44.256 --> 00:21:46.886 A:middle
to move these references
around inside their folder.

417
00:21:48.236 --> 00:21:52.406 A:middle
For that we provide a new key,
and this one is actually new

418
00:21:52.406 --> 00:21:56.896 A:middle
on iOS 8, the UbiquitousItemURL
InLocalContainerKey.

419
00:21:58.186 --> 00:22:01.276 A:middle
This key points to the
actual reference inside your

420
00:22:01.276 --> 00:22:05.256 A:middle
applicant's container, so the
user can use the file that is

421
00:22:05.256 --> 00:22:07.506 A:middle
at this location
to move it around.

422
00:22:08.976 --> 00:22:10.836 A:middle
Now, there are a few other keys.

423
00:22:11.276 --> 00:22:13.886 A:middle
It may be useful for you
to know whether a file

424
00:22:13.886 --> 00:22:14.936 A:middle
that has been returned

425
00:22:14.936 --> 00:22:17.666 A:middle
by the NSMetadataQuery
is actually external

426
00:22:17.666 --> 00:22:19.916 A:middle
to your application or not --

427
00:22:19.916 --> 00:22:21.336 A:middle
sorry, to your application's
container.

428
00:22:21.996 --> 00:22:25.146 A:middle
And for that we provide the
[inaudible] document key

429
00:22:25.796 --> 00:22:28.736 A:middle
which will return no for
local documents and yes

430
00:22:28.736 --> 00:22:29.926 A:middle
for external documents.

431
00:22:30.416 --> 00:22:34.416 A:middle
And as you've seen in Mike's
demo he showed a little badge

432
00:22:34.416 --> 00:22:39.606 A:middle
or text a label to inform
the user that the document

433
00:22:39.606 --> 00:22:43.196 A:middle
that he's shown that popped
in there was actually not

434
00:22:43.196 --> 00:22:45.336 A:middle
from the local container
but rather from text edit,

435
00:22:46.066 --> 00:22:49.746 A:middle
and to enable you to do that we
have the container display name

436
00:22:49.746 --> 00:22:52.876 A:middle
key, the container display
name key is a localized key

437
00:22:53.286 --> 00:22:59.086 A:middle
that is fit for display
DOS and for example would

438
00:22:59.086 --> 00:23:01.826 A:middle
if you extended a document

439
00:23:01.826 --> 00:23:06.256 A:middle
from text edit would
show text edit's name.

440
00:23:06.586 --> 00:23:06.966 A:middle
All right.

441
00:23:07.526 --> 00:23:09.346 A:middle
So we've got these
document references,

442
00:23:09.346 --> 00:23:10.966 A:middle
but why do you even need these?

443
00:23:12.186 --> 00:23:14.816 A:middle
So the main reason
is for security.

444
00:23:15.806 --> 00:23:19.456 A:middle
We do not generally
allow any app

445
00:23:19.626 --> 00:23:22.396 A:middle
to access any other
app's container.

446
00:23:22.896 --> 00:23:24.756 A:middle
Only the document
picker can do that.

447
00:23:26.026 --> 00:23:30.626 A:middle
The document picker is running
out-of-process, so it's not --

448
00:23:31.606 --> 00:23:35.296 A:middle
it is able and has the
sufficient entitlements

449
00:23:35.326 --> 00:23:38.616 A:middle
to be able to list all of
the document containers.

450
00:23:38.996 --> 00:23:42.466 A:middle
And the only way to
get a document inside

451
00:23:42.466 --> 00:23:45.686 A:middle
of your application is to
use the document picker.

452
00:23:46.946 --> 00:23:50.646 A:middle
To that -- for that purpose we
determine a so-called security

453
00:23:50.646 --> 00:23:54.266 A:middle
scope URL and if you've used
the sandboxing mechanism

454
00:23:54.266 --> 00:23:57.346 A:middle
on OS X you may already
know this concept

455
00:23:57.346 --> 00:23:59.726 A:middle
of a security scope URL.

456
00:23:59.756 --> 00:24:03.336 A:middle
You get a NSURL which has a
tiny bit of information attached

457
00:24:03.336 --> 00:24:05.736 A:middle
to it that informs the
kernel [assumed spelling]

458
00:24:06.126 --> 00:24:07.886 A:middle
and of course the owning app

459
00:24:08.626 --> 00:24:13.386 A:middle
that in fact the owning app is
allowed to access this document

460
00:24:13.676 --> 00:24:16.236 A:middle
and is allowed to for
example modify it as well.

461
00:24:17.136 --> 00:24:23.596 A:middle
Now importantly if you
naively were to save this URL

462
00:24:23.596 --> 00:24:26.546 A:middle
for example you would
serialize it into a strain

463
00:24:26.676 --> 00:24:29.626 A:middle
and then de-serialize
it out of the strain.

464
00:24:30.386 --> 00:24:32.446 A:middle
You would lose this
security scope

465
00:24:32.666 --> 00:24:34.846 A:middle
and that is not something
you want to happen

466
00:24:35.396 --> 00:24:38.026 A:middle
because of course the
security scope is what you use

467
00:24:38.026 --> 00:24:39.126 A:middle
to access this URL.

468
00:24:40.006 --> 00:24:42.726 A:middle
Of course you need a way to
get back to the scope URL

469
00:24:43.406 --> 00:24:47.936 A:middle
and the document references
feature is providing one

470
00:24:47.936 --> 00:24:50.256 A:middle
of the ways to get
back to these URLs.

471
00:24:50.746 --> 00:24:55.996 A:middle
If you get a NSURL from the
document reference this NSURL

472
00:24:55.996 --> 00:24:58.776 A:middle
already has the security scope
attached so you can use it

473
00:24:58.896 --> 00:25:02.186 A:middle
with your document or
with the start accessing

474
00:25:02.186 --> 00:25:06.446 A:middle
and stop accessing security
scope resource methods on NSURL,

475
00:25:06.446 --> 00:25:08.886 A:middle
but I strongly suggest
that you use UIDocument

476
00:25:08.886 --> 00:25:11.476 A:middle
because that does
all of this for you,

477
00:25:12.246 --> 00:25:15.806 A:middle
for example load
the contents off

478
00:25:16.356 --> 00:25:19.306 A:middle
of the file backed by this URL.

479
00:25:20.416 --> 00:25:23.926 A:middle
Now sometimes enumerating your
documents is not actually what

480
00:25:23.926 --> 00:25:25.556 A:middle
you want to get back
to the document.

481
00:25:26.146 --> 00:25:30.216 A:middle
For example, one thing you might
be using is state restoration

482
00:25:30.726 --> 00:25:32.546 A:middle
and in state restoration
of course what you want

483
00:25:32.546 --> 00:25:37.016 A:middle
to do is pop the user back into
the UI that they saw before.

484
00:25:37.416 --> 00:25:39.866 A:middle
So you instead of
enumerating files

485
00:25:39.916 --> 00:25:42.836 A:middle
that the user had access
previously what you want

486
00:25:42.836 --> 00:25:47.016 A:middle
to do is access a
very specific file.

487
00:25:47.406 --> 00:25:51.636 A:middle
We offer a mechanism to do that
for you, which is a bookmark.

488
00:25:52.356 --> 00:25:55.326 A:middle
The bookmark is also possibly
known to you if you've used it

489
00:25:55.326 --> 00:26:00.036 A:middle
with the sandbox on
OS X, and the bookmark

490
00:26:00.036 --> 00:26:02.886 A:middle
and codes the security
scope alongside the URL

491
00:26:03.576 --> 00:26:05.306 A:middle
so you can use the
bookmark to get back

492
00:26:05.606 --> 00:26:08.586 A:middle
to the security scope URL.

493
00:26:09.856 --> 00:26:14.486 A:middle
We offer API which
already exists.

494
00:26:15.036 --> 00:26:19.756 A:middle
The bookmarkDataWithOptions
API is used for by you

495
00:26:19.756 --> 00:26:25.146 A:middle
on a NSURL instance to create a
bookmark that you can then save.

496
00:26:25.146 --> 00:26:28.466 A:middle
It's basically [inaudible]
that you can then save

497
00:26:28.466 --> 00:26:30.696 A:middle
into a state restoration
archive for example.

498
00:26:31.536 --> 00:26:35.966 A:middle
And of course its counter-part
is a class method on NSURL.

499
00:26:36.246 --> 00:26:39.816 A:middle
The URL bears only bookmark
data which we can then use

500
00:26:40.146 --> 00:26:42.706 A:middle
to resolve this bookmark
into a NSURL

501
00:26:42.706 --> 00:26:46.456 A:middle
that has the scope attached.

502
00:26:47.526 --> 00:26:48.686 A:middle
All right.

503
00:26:48.956 --> 00:26:52.246 A:middle
Now, Mike showed you the
UIDocument picker view

504
00:26:52.246 --> 00:26:56.296 A:middle
controller in the
so-called open mode.

505
00:26:56.946 --> 00:27:00.846 A:middle
In open mode what we will do
is indeed create a bookmark

506
00:27:01.796 --> 00:27:04.266 A:middle
and a corresponding
security scope URL,

507
00:27:04.836 --> 00:27:07.366 A:middle
hand you back the
security scope URL

508
00:27:07.726 --> 00:27:10.176 A:middle
and of course place
the bookmark,

509
00:27:10.256 --> 00:27:13.306 A:middle
the reference document
inside your app's container.

510
00:27:15.046 --> 00:27:17.516 A:middle
Now sometimes that is not
what you want to do actually.

511
00:27:18.006 --> 00:27:20.236 A:middle
For example, you may
have an application

512
00:27:20.236 --> 00:27:24.216 A:middle
that does not instead of opening
specific documents may also

513
00:27:24.216 --> 00:27:27.696 A:middle
aggregate documents, keynote
for example would be one

514
00:27:27.696 --> 00:27:32.356 A:middle
of these applications in which
you for example might want

515
00:27:32.356 --> 00:27:35.236 A:middle
to open an image from an
application to insert it

516
00:27:35.236 --> 00:27:36.186 A:middle
into your presentation.

517
00:27:36.826 --> 00:27:38.606 A:middle
You'll want to maintain
a persistent reference

518
00:27:38.606 --> 00:27:41.046 A:middle
to that image, but instead
want to copy this image

519
00:27:41.086 --> 00:27:44.596 A:middle
into your presentation
as one piece.

520
00:27:45.266 --> 00:27:47.216 A:middle
And we also support
a mode for that.

521
00:27:47.216 --> 00:27:48.786 A:middle
It's the so-called import mode.

522
00:27:49.386 --> 00:27:51.176 A:middle
Import mode will not
create a bookmark,

523
00:27:51.506 --> 00:27:55.776 A:middle
but instead we'll copy the
file to a temporary location.

524
00:27:56.476 --> 00:27:58.496 A:middle
You will of course
still be granted access

525
00:27:58.496 --> 00:27:59.706 A:middle
to this temporary location,

526
00:28:00.306 --> 00:28:04.336 A:middle
but the file is not persistently
referenced by your application.

527
00:28:04.806 --> 00:28:06.786 A:middle
After your application
terminates

528
00:28:06.786 --> 00:28:11.226 A:middle
for any reason we will clean
out the temporary location

529
00:28:11.476 --> 00:28:13.546 A:middle
and you will no longer
have access so you have

530
00:28:13.546 --> 00:28:16.086 A:middle
to make a copy soon after you
get your delegate call back

531
00:28:16.136 --> 00:28:19.756 A:middle
to actually hang
onto the document.

532
00:28:19.966 --> 00:28:20.336 A:middle
All right.

533
00:28:21.046 --> 00:28:23.076 A:middle
This is reading document
and it is

534
00:28:23.076 --> 00:28:27.326 A:middle
of course a very important part,
but equally as important is

535
00:28:27.326 --> 00:28:29.866 A:middle
of course writing document
and creating new documents.

536
00:28:30.896 --> 00:28:34.666 A:middle
Now as I've mentioned you
will not have general access

537
00:28:34.666 --> 00:28:38.916 A:middle
to containers outside of
your app's own container.

538
00:28:40.196 --> 00:28:43.186 A:middle
But of course you can write
into that container, so,

539
00:28:43.186 --> 00:28:45.606 A:middle
or possibly into a
temporary location.

540
00:28:46.036 --> 00:28:49.286 A:middle
So to create a new
UIDocument that is --

541
00:28:49.286 --> 00:28:52.436 A:middle
sorry, a new document on disk

542
00:28:52.936 --> 00:28:56.346 A:middle
that is exactly what
you want to do.

543
00:28:56.706 --> 00:29:00.266 A:middle
You can then use a special
document picker mode to move

544
00:29:00.266 --> 00:29:02.326 A:middle
that document outside
of your app's container

545
00:29:02.686 --> 00:29:05.336 A:middle
but again the user chooses
where to move the document.

546
00:29:06.976 --> 00:29:08.876 A:middle
Let's have a quick
look at how that works.

547
00:29:09.696 --> 00:29:12.776 A:middle
You would of course you
already have a document,

548
00:29:12.776 --> 00:29:16.706 A:middle
Doc 3 in this case, and you
use the initWithURL method

549
00:29:16.706 --> 00:29:21.976 A:middle
on your document picker with the
URL of your existing document

550
00:29:22.606 --> 00:29:25.876 A:middle
to allow the user to
choose a new location.

551
00:29:26.766 --> 00:29:30.726 A:middle
The user now chooses a new
location and we move the file

552
00:29:30.726 --> 00:29:31.996 A:middle
into the new location.

553
00:29:33.206 --> 00:29:36.556 A:middle
We will return a
document reference to you,

554
00:29:37.216 --> 00:29:40.206 A:middle
so you still maintain
access to the document.

555
00:29:40.866 --> 00:29:44.016 A:middle
And this URL is effectively
exactly like one

556
00:29:44.016 --> 00:29:47.066 A:middle
that has been returned to
you by the open mechanism,

557
00:29:47.646 --> 00:29:51.756 A:middle
so you can enumerate this
new document preference

558
00:29:51.806 --> 00:29:53.286 A:middle
in your NSMetadataQuery.

559
00:29:54.426 --> 00:29:57.496 A:middle
Now of course sometimes that
is exactly not what you want.

560
00:29:57.496 --> 00:29:58.636 A:middle
You don't want the reference.

561
00:29:59.266 --> 00:30:03.146 A:middle
So we also have an expert
mode which allows you

562
00:30:03.146 --> 00:30:05.236 A:middle
to forego the entire
reference thing.

563
00:30:05.236 --> 00:30:09.366 A:middle
In that case we will make
a copy of your document

564
00:30:09.706 --> 00:30:14.486 A:middle
into another app's container
and that is basically it.

565
00:30:15.226 --> 00:30:18.086 A:middle
Okay. Let me give a
quick summary of how

566
00:30:18.086 --> 00:30:20.916 A:middle
to use document management here.

567
00:30:21.256 --> 00:30:24.826 A:middle
We've seen that you can use the
document reference mechanism

568
00:30:24.826 --> 00:30:30.236 A:middle
to enumerate documents that
have been previously used by,

569
00:30:30.346 --> 00:30:32.066 A:middle
or granted access by the user.

570
00:30:32.906 --> 00:30:35.736 A:middle
We've also seen that you can use
bookmarks for state restoration

571
00:30:36.506 --> 00:30:42.356 A:middle
and we've also shown you quickly
how to use the import open

572
00:30:42.356 --> 00:30:43.686 A:middle
and export and move modes.

573
00:30:45.316 --> 00:30:50.276 A:middle
And all of these of course play
together to enable your user

574
00:30:50.276 --> 00:30:53.366 A:middle
to access all of their iCloud
documents, not merely those

575
00:30:53.406 --> 00:30:54.576 A:middle
that are inside your folder.

576
00:30:56.166 --> 00:30:59.226 A:middle
But you noticed I said all of
your iCloud documents here,

577
00:30:59.996 --> 00:31:05.816 A:middle
and of course your users
may have different locations

578
00:31:05.816 --> 00:31:07.276 A:middle
for storing their documents.

579
00:31:07.666 --> 00:31:10.636 A:middle
For example, you may be
part of an enterprise

580
00:31:10.636 --> 00:31:12.696 A:middle
that has their own
storage management system,

581
00:31:13.576 --> 00:31:16.166 A:middle
and of course it would be grand

582
00:31:16.166 --> 00:31:19.436 A:middle
if you could grant
your users access

583
00:31:19.436 --> 00:31:21.256 A:middle
to those documents as well.

584
00:31:21.816 --> 00:31:23.616 A:middle
And for that we are
introducing a new feature,

585
00:31:23.666 --> 00:31:25.796 A:middle
the so-called document
provider extensions.

586
00:31:27.486 --> 00:31:29.996 A:middle
Now, what is a document
provider extension?

587
00:31:30.846 --> 00:31:34.226 A:middle
A document provider extension
is an alternate way for you

588
00:31:34.226 --> 00:31:37.696 A:middle
or a third party to
provide document storage.

589
00:31:38.536 --> 00:31:42.706 A:middle
From the host application's
perspective this works exactly

590
00:31:42.706 --> 00:31:46.056 A:middle
the same way as the pre-existing
iCloud storage location.

591
00:31:47.206 --> 00:31:51.616 A:middle
The user is able to select
one of these storage locations

592
00:31:51.616 --> 00:31:53.476 A:middle
from the document picker

593
00:31:53.476 --> 00:31:57.996 A:middle
and they can use these storage
locations in the exact same mode

594
00:31:57.996 --> 00:32:02.376 A:middle
so they can open documents
and move out documents

595
00:32:02.376 --> 00:32:03.676 A:middle
to the storage locations.

596
00:32:05.036 --> 00:32:10.826 A:middle
We implement these using two
different separate extensions,

597
00:32:11.396 --> 00:32:15.586 A:middle
the first of which is the
so-called document picker

598
00:32:15.716 --> 00:32:19.536 A:middle
extension which provides
a UI view control subclass

599
00:32:20.076 --> 00:32:24.646 A:middle
that is effectively free
form that the user can use

600
00:32:24.646 --> 00:32:28.676 A:middle
to choose a document from
your storage location or from

601
00:32:28.676 --> 00:32:30.416 A:middle
of course from someone
at the storage locations.

602
00:32:31.076 --> 00:32:34.366 A:middle
This UR document picker
subclass is displayed as part

603
00:32:34.366 --> 00:32:36.186 A:middle
of the document picker
view controller

604
00:32:36.336 --> 00:32:38.736 A:middle
so it's effectively
contained inside one

605
00:32:38.736 --> 00:32:42.306 A:middle
of these view controllers just
like the iCloud picker is.

606
00:32:42.766 --> 00:32:45.166 A:middle
There is also a separate
second extension

607
00:32:45.416 --> 00:32:47.446 A:middle
which is the so-called
file provider extension.

608
00:32:48.146 --> 00:32:52.156 A:middle
The file provider extension is
a non-UI extension which deals

609
00:32:52.206 --> 00:32:55.576 A:middle
with actually providing the
files, the [inaudible] cases

610
00:32:55.576 --> 00:33:03.366 A:middle
where you want to provide files
would be for example ensuring

611
00:33:03.366 --> 00:33:08.606 A:middle
that a file on disk is
current, uploading a file

612
00:33:08.606 --> 00:33:13.856 A:middle
that has been changed by
the user, or enabling us

613
00:33:13.896 --> 00:33:17.076 A:middle
to identify a file,
so the user can save,

614
00:33:17.346 --> 00:33:20.256 A:middle
or the user's app can save a
bookmark for state restoration.

615
00:33:20.856 --> 00:33:24.766 A:middle
The file provider extension --

616
00:33:24.766 --> 00:33:27.256 A:middle
access to the file provider
extension is modulated

617
00:33:27.256 --> 00:33:30.786 A:middle
through file coordination which
means that all accesses that go

618
00:33:30.786 --> 00:33:33.266 A:middle
through file coordination will
automatically do the right thing

619
00:33:33.656 --> 00:33:35.736 A:middle
with regards to providing
access to the file.

620
00:33:35.896 --> 00:33:38.376 A:middle
This is another important case

621
00:33:38.376 --> 00:33:40.726 A:middle
where you absolutely must
use file coordination

622
00:33:40.726 --> 00:33:43.666 A:middle
or everything else --
everything will just not work.

623
00:33:44.976 --> 00:33:45.856 A:middle
All right.

624
00:33:46.056 --> 00:33:50.016 A:middle
Let's have a quick look
at how the data flow works

625
00:33:50.016 --> 00:33:53.616 A:middle
with a file provider
extension specifically

626
00:33:53.616 --> 00:33:55.146 A:middle
when reading a file from disk.

627
00:33:56.306 --> 00:33:59.146 A:middle
Let's say you have a host
app and this host app is used

628
00:33:59.146 --> 00:34:00.876 A:middle
by the user who is trying

629
00:34:00.876 --> 00:34:03.556 A:middle
to actually open a
document in this case.

630
00:34:04.286 --> 00:34:08.806 A:middle
So the host app through some UI
action is calling the ubiquitous

631
00:34:08.806 --> 00:34:10.306 A:middle
document types in mode method

632
00:34:10.936 --> 00:34:13.186 A:middle
on the UI document
picker view controller,

633
00:34:14.396 --> 00:34:16.025 A:middle
and now the document picker --

634
00:34:16.025 --> 00:34:20.106 A:middle
well, the user inside the
document picker selects a

635
00:34:20.106 --> 00:34:24.996 A:middle
third-party document
picker extension, yours.

636
00:34:26.536 --> 00:34:30.156 A:middle
We instantiate your
UIDocument picker extension

637
00:34:30.606 --> 00:34:33.485 A:middle
and send it prepare for
presentation in mode call.

638
00:34:34.286 --> 00:34:36.775 A:middle
Now this method is
called with the mode

639
00:34:36.775 --> 00:34:38.076 A:middle
that the user has
actually selected

640
00:34:38.076 --> 00:34:40.636 A:middle
and at this point you want

641
00:34:40.636 --> 00:34:43.585 A:middle
to probably display a view
controller that corresponds

642
00:34:43.585 --> 00:34:46.206 A:middle
to the mode that
the user has chosen.

643
00:34:46.206 --> 00:34:48.556 A:middle
For example, for the
open mode you would want

644
00:34:48.556 --> 00:34:51.456 A:middle
to display a view controller
that allows the user

645
00:34:51.456 --> 00:34:56.255 A:middle
to pick a specific document
and of course for the move

646
00:34:56.255 --> 00:34:58.816 A:middle
out mode you will want to
display a view controller

647
00:34:58.816 --> 00:35:03.246 A:middle
that allows them to select a
location instead of a document.

648
00:35:03.436 --> 00:35:03.776 A:middle
All right.

649
00:35:04.686 --> 00:35:10.006 A:middle
The user now goes ahead and uses
your UI to select a document

650
00:35:10.686 --> 00:35:13.716 A:middle
at which point after the user
has confirmed their intentions

651
00:35:14.456 --> 00:35:17.676 A:middle
you have to determine
which location

652
00:35:17.716 --> 00:35:21.056 A:middle
in the file system you want
to store this document in.

653
00:35:21.056 --> 00:35:26.086 A:middle
You can then call the
dismiss grant access --

654
00:35:26.086 --> 00:35:30.106 A:middle
the granting access to
URL method on self, well,

655
00:35:30.106 --> 00:35:35.976 A:middle
that is your document picker
view controller subclass,

656
00:35:36.846 --> 00:35:42.046 A:middle
and thereby inform us
about your intention

657
00:35:42.046 --> 00:35:44.146 A:middle
to actually the user
to access this URL.

658
00:35:45.346 --> 00:35:48.496 A:middle
The document picker will
then call the document picker

659
00:35:48.496 --> 00:35:51.636 A:middle
didPickDocument AtURL
method on its delegate

660
00:35:52.466 --> 00:35:55.576 A:middle
to inform the user app that
the user has just picked

661
00:35:55.576 --> 00:35:56.286 A:middle
this document.

662
00:35:57.646 --> 00:35:59.756 A:middle
Now what the user is
probably wanting to do is

663
00:35:59.906 --> 00:36:01.776 A:middle
to read the document
at this location.

664
00:36:01.776 --> 00:36:04.846 A:middle
It will use the
NSFileCoordinator methods,

665
00:36:05.236 --> 00:36:07.856 A:middle
for example, coordinateReading
ItemAtURL

666
00:36:08.616 --> 00:36:11.696 A:middle
and its file coordinator
that it should ensure

667
00:36:11.696 --> 00:36:13.166 A:middle
that the document
is actually present.

668
00:36:13.986 --> 00:36:17.336 A:middle
NSFileCoordinator will call out
to your file provider extension,

669
00:36:17.336 --> 00:36:19.046 A:middle
that's your tiny
non-UI extension,

670
00:36:19.166 --> 00:36:22.196 A:middle
with the startProvidingItemAtURL
method.

671
00:36:22.996 --> 00:36:25.126 A:middle
This method take a
completion call back

672
00:36:25.126 --> 00:36:29.906 A:middle
which you can call once
you're sure that the item

673
00:36:30.136 --> 00:36:33.106 A:middle
at this specific location
is actually current.

674
00:36:33.806 --> 00:36:39.596 A:middle
So once you call that completion
call back on -- sorry.

675
00:36:40.036 --> 00:36:43.256 A:middle
Once you call that completion
call back the file coordinator

676
00:36:43.256 --> 00:36:45.956 A:middle
will know that it is now
able to unlock the file

677
00:36:46.716 --> 00:36:49.006 A:middle
and it itself can call
its accessorBlock.

678
00:36:50.166 --> 00:36:52.396 A:middle
And now inside your
accessorBlock the user

679
00:36:52.396 --> 00:36:54.936 A:middle
application can use this UR
document like it sees fit,

680
00:36:55.326 --> 00:36:57.686 A:middle
for example using data
with contents of URL

681
00:36:58.076 --> 00:37:00.966 A:middle
to be able to read the file.

682
00:37:02.506 --> 00:37:06.236 A:middle
Let's take a quick
look at how security

683
00:37:06.276 --> 00:37:12.256 A:middle
and persistent file access
works for document providers.

684
00:37:12.736 --> 00:37:14.666 A:middle
Unlike the iCloud
document provider,

685
00:37:14.666 --> 00:37:18.546 A:middle
which saves the special document
reference inside an iCloud

686
00:37:18.546 --> 00:37:21.816 A:middle
container the document provider
extensions don't take part

687
00:37:21.816 --> 00:37:23.196 A:middle
in the document reference
mechanism.

688
00:37:24.266 --> 00:37:28.086 A:middle
This is because of course
in this let's say we're

689
00:37:28.086 --> 00:37:30.876 A:middle
in an enterprise setting our
enterprise administration has

690
00:37:30.906 --> 00:37:33.306 A:middle
decided that they do
not want to use iCloud,

691
00:37:33.306 --> 00:37:36.966 A:middle
but of course we still want
this document provider extension

692
00:37:36.966 --> 00:37:41.456 A:middle
mechanism to still work because
our enterprise has given us an

693
00:37:41.456 --> 00:37:46.636 A:middle
application that can be
used to access the files

694
00:37:46.636 --> 00:37:48.156 A:middle
on the enterprise's file server.

695
00:37:49.276 --> 00:37:53.766 A:middle
So it's no good to use iCloud in
this case of course to get back

696
00:37:53.766 --> 00:37:54.976 A:middle
to your document preferences.

697
00:37:55.736 --> 00:37:58.546 A:middle
But of course the bookmark
mechanism will still work.

698
00:37:59.816 --> 00:38:04.796 A:middle
To that end the file provider
is able or has to be able

699
00:38:04.796 --> 00:38:10.896 A:middle
to resolve or resolve
into a file URL

700
00:38:11.216 --> 00:38:12.326 A:middle
and the other way around.

701
00:38:13.556 --> 00:38:18.326 A:middle
Now for security purposes
we have an isolation layer

702
00:38:18.326 --> 00:38:20.136 A:middle
that saves the state information

703
00:38:20.136 --> 00:38:23.486 A:middle
about which application
has been granted access

704
00:38:23.486 --> 00:38:26.716 A:middle
to which identifier --
inside which file provider,

705
00:38:27.686 --> 00:38:31.466 A:middle
and this is also something that
we use these identifiers for.

706
00:38:32.186 --> 00:38:36.536 A:middle
Let's have a quick look at how a
bookmark is created and resolved

707
00:38:36.686 --> 00:38:38.486 A:middle
by a document provider
extension.

708
00:38:39.486 --> 00:38:42.586 A:middle
Let's say we have our host
app and the host app is

709
00:38:42.796 --> 00:38:47.856 A:middle
for some reason going into
the background and just wants

710
00:38:47.856 --> 00:38:52.946 A:middle
to save its state it will call
the bookmarkData WithOptions

711
00:38:52.946 --> 00:38:57.456 A:middle
method on NSURL and NSURL
will call the persistent

712
00:38:57.456 --> 00:39:01.816 A:middle
IdentifierForItemAtURL method
on your file provider extension

713
00:39:01.816 --> 00:39:04.556 A:middle
which can then return
a persistentdentifier.

714
00:39:05.006 --> 00:39:06.686 A:middle
This might be a database key

715
00:39:07.116 --> 00:39:08.936 A:middle
or it might be something
much simpler.

716
00:39:09.366 --> 00:39:12.636 A:middle
It depends on the actual way

717
00:39:12.636 --> 00:39:17.126 A:middle
that your file provider is
actually accessing files.

718
00:39:18.116 --> 00:39:21.546 A:middle
Now at some point it will
return the personal identifier

719
00:39:21.546 --> 00:39:25.116 A:middle
which is just a freeform
NS string to the NSURL

720
00:39:25.516 --> 00:39:29.176 A:middle
and NSURL will package
that up and return it

721
00:39:29.176 --> 00:39:32.126 A:middle
as the opaque data block
that has the bookmark data.

722
00:39:32.606 --> 00:39:37.076 A:middle
At this point our user app
can go and save its state

723
00:39:37.606 --> 00:39:41.366 A:middle
and for example get
terminated in some way,

724
00:39:41.366 --> 00:39:43.746 A:middle
for example the user
reboots 35s.

725
00:39:44.816 --> 00:39:49.946 A:middle
Now at some point later the user
is reopening their app the user

726
00:39:49.946 --> 00:39:54.086 A:middle
app is doing state
restoration and in the process

727
00:39:54.086 --> 00:39:56.056 A:middle
of doing this is calling the URL

728
00:39:56.056 --> 00:39:58.676 A:middle
by resulting bookmark
data on NSURL.

729
00:39:59.826 --> 00:40:04.086 A:middle
We hand the identifier back to
your file provider which can

730
00:40:04.086 --> 00:40:08.046 A:middle
in the URLForItemWith
PersistentIdentifier method

731
00:40:08.046 --> 00:40:14.406 A:middle
and it can then resolve this
identifier into a NSURL on disk.

732
00:40:14.816 --> 00:40:19.336 A:middle
Now, soon after we call the
providePlaceholder AtURL method

733
00:40:20.066 --> 00:40:23.236 A:middle
which you can use to
provide a small placeholder

734
00:40:23.666 --> 00:40:28.246 A:middle
that can be used
in correspondence

735
00:40:28.246 --> 00:40:33.506 A:middle
with the previously discussed
getPromisedItem ResourceValueby

736
00:40:33.506 --> 00:40:37.256 A:middle
theUser app to merely get
Metadata on this file.

737
00:40:37.766 --> 00:40:43.346 A:middle
But what it can also do at this
point eagerly download the file.

738
00:40:44.426 --> 00:40:47.276 A:middle
We will at least ensure
that you are providing a

739
00:40:47.276 --> 00:40:48.086 A:middle
placeholder though.

740
00:40:49.966 --> 00:40:54.486 A:middle
You pass the NSURL off
the file on disk back.

741
00:40:55.036 --> 00:40:58.856 A:middle
The NSURL method can
now return this NSURL

742
00:40:58.856 --> 00:41:01.806 A:middle
and the host app can use the
getPromisedItem ResourceValue

743
00:41:02.286 --> 00:41:05.996 A:middle
to merely read metadata
or use FileCoordinator AP

744
00:41:05.996 --> 00:41:10.566 A:middle
on the NSURL to access the file.

745
00:41:10.736 --> 00:41:12.616 A:middle
Well, no matter what you
have chosen that we will

746
00:41:12.616 --> 00:41:17.016 A:middle
at least call you to ensure if
the user uses file coordination

747
00:41:17.016 --> 00:41:19.606 A:middle
in this case to load the
actual data from this document

748
00:41:20.056 --> 00:41:23.786 A:middle
to ensure that the file
on disk is current.

749
00:41:23.786 --> 00:41:24.116 A:middle
All right.

750
00:41:24.666 --> 00:41:26.656 A:middle
We've seen how reading
works and how getting back

751
00:41:26.656 --> 00:41:27.686 A:middle
to your documents works.

752
00:41:28.186 --> 00:41:31.286 A:middle
Let's have a quick look at
how writing files works.

753
00:41:31.916 --> 00:41:35.246 A:middle
In this case, the user is using,

754
00:41:35.246 --> 00:41:39.666 A:middle
or the host app is using
the file coordination API

755
00:41:39.666 --> 00:41:42.786 A:middle
to actually write data to disk.

756
00:41:43.796 --> 00:41:47.116 A:middle
So it would do a route
coordinated write

757
00:41:47.796 --> 00:41:50.196 A:middle
to the file inside your
storage apps folder.

758
00:41:50.536 --> 00:41:53.336 A:middle
The file is now changed inside
your storage apps folder.

759
00:41:54.826 --> 00:41:59.306 A:middle
At some point very soon after,
but importantly to note not

760
00:41:59.566 --> 00:42:02.776 A:middle
in a blocking way, so the file
coordination will have succeeded

761
00:42:02.776 --> 00:42:06.446 A:middle
by this point, we will
call itemChanged AtURL

762
00:42:06.446 --> 00:42:07.766 A:middle
on your file provider.

763
00:42:07.766 --> 00:42:10.946 A:middle
At this point your
file provider can go

764
00:42:10.946 --> 00:42:13.166 A:middle
and for example initiate
an upload of this file,

765
00:42:13.836 --> 00:42:17.606 A:middle
or at the very least mark it as
being dirty and needing upload,

766
00:42:17.606 --> 00:42:23.886 A:middle
so you don't accidently
overwrite it at a later point.

767
00:42:25.076 --> 00:42:25.616 A:middle
All right.

768
00:42:25.926 --> 00:42:27.926 A:middle
Let's have a quick
look at how that works.

769
00:42:28.446 --> 00:42:34.546 A:middle
What I've done is I've built a
very small sample project using

770
00:42:34.546 --> 00:42:37.146 A:middle
the template that
comes with [inaudible].

771
00:42:37.146 --> 00:42:39.306 A:middle
It's very nice because
it provides you

772
00:42:39.306 --> 00:42:42.806 A:middle
with almost everything
you need at the start.

773
00:42:43.596 --> 00:42:46.636 A:middle
We can use the target here
and use the application

774
00:42:46.636 --> 00:42:50.236 A:middle
and get extension template
for the document picker

775
00:42:50.526 --> 00:42:53.246 A:middle
and basically choose a
name here and it'll set

776
00:42:53.246 --> 00:42:55.226 A:middle
up the two different extensions.

777
00:42:56.306 --> 00:42:59.666 A:middle
Inside my project I just have
the two different extensions,

778
00:43:00.066 --> 00:43:03.146 A:middle
one folder here for
the actual picker.

779
00:43:03.516 --> 00:43:05.926 A:middle
I'm doing a text
snippet picker to go

780
00:43:05.926 --> 00:43:08.286 A:middle
with the text display
app that Mike showed.

781
00:43:09.246 --> 00:43:11.446 A:middle
And inside this I
have a whole bunch

782
00:43:11.446 --> 00:43:14.506 A:middle
of files while are
basically, well,

783
00:43:14.506 --> 00:43:17.386 A:middle
classes to display some
sort of picking UI,

784
00:43:17.386 --> 00:43:20.796 A:middle
but the important
part is my subclass

785
00:43:20.796 --> 00:43:23.106 A:middle
of UIDocumentPicker
ExtensionViewController here.

786
00:43:23.506 --> 00:43:28.796 A:middle
And inside this subclass
the important parts are the

787
00:43:29.086 --> 00:43:32.206 A:middle
prepareForPresentationinMode
method, let me make this big

788
00:43:32.206 --> 00:43:36.326 A:middle
so you can see this, and in this
PresentationinMode method what I

789
00:43:36.386 --> 00:43:41.246 A:middle
want to do is basically
display a specific,

790
00:43:42.006 --> 00:43:44.646 A:middle
in this case I'm using a
collection view controller

791
00:43:44.646 --> 00:43:49.866 A:middle
to display a list of documents
and I'm displaying this.

792
00:43:49.866 --> 00:43:52.776 A:middle
And all of my picking
actually is not handled

793
00:43:52.846 --> 00:43:54.986 A:middle
by my DocumentPicker
ViewController,

794
00:43:55.276 --> 00:43:56.276 A:middle
but by a subclass.

795
00:43:56.736 --> 00:44:00.846 A:middle
Of course I use a delegate
pattern to get back

796
00:44:00.846 --> 00:44:04.556 A:middle
to my main class once the
user has picked a document

797
00:44:04.676 --> 00:44:07.446 A:middle
and we'll call this method here

798
00:44:07.546 --> 00:44:09.616 A:middle
and inside this method
all I have

799
00:44:09.666 --> 00:44:12.696 A:middle
to do is call the
dismissGrantingAccesstoURL

800
00:44:13.006 --> 00:44:16.086 A:middle
with the file URL that I've
previously written out.

801
00:44:17.306 --> 00:44:23.576 A:middle
Now the document file
provider here is very simple

802
00:44:23.576 --> 00:44:24.206 A:middle
in this case.

803
00:44:25.046 --> 00:44:28.896 A:middle
The interesting method for this
demo is the startProvidingItem

804
00:44:28.896 --> 00:44:32.586 A:middle
withURL method which I implement
to ensure that the snippet

805
00:44:32.586 --> 00:44:36.156 A:middle
at this URL is current and then
call the completion handler.

806
00:44:36.636 --> 00:44:39.836 A:middle
Let's have a quick look at
how that looks on the machine.

807
00:44:40.786 --> 00:44:41.156 A:middle
All right.

808
00:44:41.666 --> 00:44:46.466 A:middle
I've got my demo up here which
is basically since I started

809
00:44:46.516 --> 00:44:47.856 A:middle
from the template
just an empty app.

810
00:44:48.166 --> 00:44:50.766 A:middle
So instead I'm going to
pop off the document picker

811
00:44:51.416 --> 00:44:53.566 A:middle
and you notice I don't
even have any documents

812
00:44:53.566 --> 00:44:58.096 A:middle
in my iCloud account,
but when I pop

813
00:44:58.096 --> 00:45:02.596 A:middle
up this document picker menu
here I see a list including the

814
00:45:02.596 --> 00:45:06.396 A:middle
iCloud document picker and my
SnippetPicker, and if I pop

815
00:45:06.396 --> 00:45:10.056 A:middle
up the SnippetPicker what is
displayed is my SnippetPicker

816
00:45:10.056 --> 00:45:13.236 A:middle
view controller and I
can use that to pick any

817
00:45:13.236 --> 00:45:15.136 A:middle
of these documents
or Snippets in here.

818
00:45:15.956 --> 00:45:20.026 A:middle
So when I pick these with
the exact same sample app

819
00:45:20.026 --> 00:45:24.046 A:middle
that Mike showed you I'm
able to access these Snippets

820
00:45:24.226 --> 00:45:27.446 A:middle
from my little document
picker app.

821
00:45:27.706 --> 00:45:33.876 A:middle
Now when you use the
[inaudible] to try this out note

822
00:45:33.876 --> 00:45:37.276 A:middle
that this Snippet that the
document picker you will create

823
00:45:37.276 --> 00:45:41.176 A:middle
will not show up by default so
you can use the little locations

824
00:45:41.336 --> 00:45:46.646 A:middle
in the navigation bar of
the iCloud document picker.

825
00:45:47.336 --> 00:45:48.976 A:middle
It has a little more pop

826
00:45:48.976 --> 00:45:52.636 A:middle
out where you can enable
the Snippet picker.

827
00:45:52.816 --> 00:45:53.186 A:middle
All right.

828
00:45:54.616 --> 00:45:59.116 A:middle
Now let's switch back to slides.

829
00:46:00.566 --> 00:46:04.106 A:middle
Cool. To summarize the demo,
we've got an Xcode template

830
00:46:04.106 --> 00:46:06.986 A:middle
to get you started with the
document picker mechanism.

831
00:46:07.726 --> 00:46:13.716 A:middle
The document picker, or a
Document Provider will show

832
00:46:13.716 --> 00:46:15.656 A:middle
up right next to
the iCloud picker

833
00:46:15.656 --> 00:46:18.736 A:middle
if the user installs them.

834
00:46:19.856 --> 00:46:25.106 A:middle
And we also have
sample code available

835
00:46:25.106 --> 00:46:29.576 A:middle
on the session home page
that will enable you

836
00:46:29.576 --> 00:46:31.156 A:middle
to quickly test this out.

837
00:46:31.666 --> 00:46:35.776 A:middle
The sample code is basically a
little test app that we wrote

838
00:46:35.846 --> 00:46:41.126 A:middle
to be able to display each
of the document picker modes.

839
00:46:41.276 --> 00:46:45.186 A:middle
Cool. So that's Document
Providers

840
00:46:46.056 --> 00:46:51.166 A:middle
and that almost concludes the
session, but I have a little bit

841
00:46:51.166 --> 00:46:56.686 A:middle
of information for
you to inform you how

842
00:46:56.686 --> 00:47:01.296 A:middle
since we have this new Cloud
Drive mechanism how the
